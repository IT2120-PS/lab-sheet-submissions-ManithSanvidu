#1. A train arrives at a station uniformly between 8:00 a.m. and 8:40 a.m. Let the random variable X represent the number of minutes the train arrives after 8:00a.m. What is the probability that the train arrives between 8:10 a.m. and 8:25a.m.?
#P(10<X<25)=P(x<=25)-P(X<=10)
punif(25,min=0,max=40,lower.tail=TRUE)-punif(10,min=0,max=40,lower.tail=TRUE)

#2.The time (in hours) to complete a software update is exponentially distributed with rate Î» =1/3.Find the probability that an update will take at most 2 hours.
#P(X<=2)
pexp(2,rate=1/3,lower.tail=TRUE)

#3. Suppose IQ scores are normally distributed with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.
#i. What is the probability that a randomly selected person has an IQ above 130?
#P(X>130)
pnorm(130,mean=100,sd=15,lower.tail=FALSE)

#ii. What IQ score represents the 95th percentile?
#P(X<=b)=0.95%
qnorm(0.95,mean=100,sd=15)
